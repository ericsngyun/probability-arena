# Deployment Report — Probability Arena on EVO-X2 (`mikolabs`)

Date: 2026-07-03 (UTC) · Status: **deployed, timer enabled and scheduled**
Companion: `DEPLOYMENT_AUDIT_EVO_X2.md` (Phase 1 audit and path rationale)
**Updated 2026-07-03: OPS-003 deployed — see "OPS-003 update" section.**
**Updated 2026-07-03 (later): OPS-005 + baseball canary rollout — see final section.**

## Deployment summary

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Path chosen | **Host Python venv + systemd user timer** (Docker Compose rejected: would add a redundant Postgres/Redis set to an already loaded shared host) |
| Repo path | `/home/miko_node_001/projects/probability-arena` |
| Commit deployed | `d009433` (`main`; includes MVP-004D `0cd62b0`) |
| Python / venv | Python 3.12.3 → `.venv` inside the repo (created `--without-pip` + get-pip bootstrap; host lacks `python3.12-venv` and passwordless sudo — no system packages installed) |
| Database | **SQLite** at `~/projects/probability-arena/data/probability_arena.db`, Alembic at head **`0011`**, 14 tables. Not Postgres: `master-postgres` belongs to the awaas stack, publishes no host port, and pgbouncer has no db routing (see audit). |
| Redis | Default `redis://localhost:6379/0` — intentionally unreachable on this host. The baseline CLI never uses Redis; the app's only Redis use (API candidate cache) degrades gracefully to cache-miss. |
| LLM / external flags | `ENABLE_LLM_RESOLUTION=false`, `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH=false`, `ENABLE_LLM_FORECASTING=false` (verified in `.env`) |
| Trading surface | **None.** Safety grep on the deployed tree found no order/wallet/execution/live-or-paper-trading/sizing/EV/recommendation implementation surface. The adjacent `~/awaas/trading/` project on this host is unrelated and shares nothing with this deployment (no env, no DB, no services). |
| Timer | `probability-arena-baseline.timer` (user unit) **enabled + active (waiting)**; every 4 h (`OnCalendar=*-*-* 00/4:00:00`, `RandomizedDelaySec=300`, `Persistent=true`). Next trigger at install time: 04:04 UTC. Lingering already enabled, so the timer survives logout/reboot. No root/system units touched. |

## Verification results (all on EVO-X2)

- **Dry run** (`run-baseline --dry-run`): pipeline run 1, `status=dry_run`, 8 skipped stage audit rows, 50 ms, no downstream rows.
- **Manual live baseline** (`--scan-limit 300 --candidate-limit 8 --sync-outcome-limit 20 --score-limit 100`): pipeline run 2, `status=completed` in 18.2 s — scan 300/300, enrich 8/8, assess 8/8, research 8/8, forecast 8/8, sync 20/20, score 8/8, report ✓. Confirms Kalshi egress from EVO-X2 works (read-only GETs; no credentials, no trading permissions).
- **systemd-triggered run** (`systemctl --user start …service`): pipeline run 3 with full `.env` defaults, `status=completed` in 54.3 s (scan 500/500, 20 candidates through the chain, 200 outcomes synced, 20 new scores with the 8 already-current scores correctly skipped by dedup). Exit `0/SUCCESS`, clean journal.
- **`pipeline-status`**: lists runs 3/2/1 with correct statuses and full stage table.
- **`calibration-report`**: works; all scores currently `pending_outcome` (forecasts are on unresolved markets — expected on day one; resolved counts accrue as markets settle and later runs re-score).
- **Timer status**: `active (waiting)`, trigger scheduled, `Triggers: probability-arena-baseline.service`.

## Caveats

1. **SQLite, not Postgres.** Deliberate (see audit). If a dedicated Postgres is provisioned later, point `DATABASE_URL` at it and rerun migrations — `run_migrations()` builds from zero; note the SQLite history would need a one-off copy if continuity matters.
2. **Pre-existing failed user units** (`arena-daily.service`, `syncthing.service`) keep the user manager `degraded`. Unrelated to this deployment; not touched.
3. **The service unit is `disabled` by design** — it is activated by the enabled timer (`TriggeredBy`), which is the correct oneshot+timer shape.
4. Scores stay `pending_outcome` until markets settle; with same-day sports dominating candidates, resolved scores should appear within ~24 h of runs.
5. `.env` currently holds no secrets (no Kalshi credentials needed for read-only data; LLM disabled). If credentials are ever added, they stay in `.env` (mode 600 recommended) and must never be committed.

## Operations

Disable the schedule:
```bash
systemctl --user disable --now probability-arena-baseline.timer
```
(Re-enable: `systemctl --user enable --now probability-arena-baseline.timer`)

Inspect logs and state:
```bash
systemctl --user status probability-arena-baseline.timer
systemctl --user status probability-arena-baseline.service
journalctl --user -u probability-arena-baseline.service -n 100 --no-pager
systemctl --user list-timers | grep probability-arena
cd ~/projects/probability-arena && .venv/bin/python -m app.cli pipeline-status
cd ~/projects/probability-arena && .venv/bin/python -m app.cli calibration-report
```

Update the deployment:
```bash
cd ~/projects/probability-arena
git pull --ff-only
.venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements-dev.txt   # if deps changed
.venv/bin/python -m app.cli run-baseline --dry-run # migrations + audit sanity
```

## OPS-003 update (2026-07-03): watcher + retention live

Deployed `27a4501` (OPS-002 watcher + OPS-003 retention) following the README sequence: pull → deps → migrations via dry-run (now at Alembic **`0012`**) → two manual `watch-once` passes (36 candidates, clean) → `db-stats` sanity → **retention timer installed first** → `ENABLE_REALTIME_WATCHER=true` appended to `.env` (key predated OPS-002, so it was added rather than edited) → watcher service enabled.

| Unit | State | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| `probability-arena-baseline.timer` | active/enabled (unchanged) | every 4 h |
| `probability-arena-retention.timer` | active/enabled (**new**) | daily (defaults: ticks 7 d, watcher runs 30 d, pipeline 90 d, signals kept forever) |
| `probability-arena-watcher.service` | active/enabled (**new**) | continuous 60 s loop over the latest scan's eligible candidates |

First-minutes verification: 11 watcher runs, 396 ticks, and **6 real signals** (3 `price_move_threshold`, 3 `spread_tightened`) from live MLB/WNBA markets — e.g. `KXMLBTOTAL-26JUL021915STLATL-17` midpoint 0.10 → 0.245. Retention dry-run on the live DB counted 0 (nothing old enough yet), as expected.

**Fix applied during deployment:** the long-running watcher's `print()` summaries were block-buffered under systemd (journal showed only stderr logging; DB rows proved the loop was healthy). Added `Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` to the watcher unit (repo + installed copy); per-pass summaries now stream to journald.

Watcher ops:
```bash
systemctl --user status probability-arena-watcher.service
journalctl --user -u probability-arena-watcher.service -n 50 --no-pager
systemctl --user disable --now probability-arena-watcher.service   # stop the loop
systemctl --user disable --now probability-arena-retention.timer   # stop daily pruning
cd ~/projects/probability-arena && .venv/bin/python -m app.cli db-stats
```

Still read-only end to end: signals are informational; no EV, trading, orders, wallets, sizing, or execution surface exists.

## OPS-005 + baseball canary rollout (2026-07-03, ~04:20 UTC)

Deployed **`eeb799d` → `c35e704`** (OPS-004 signal workflow, MVP-004E baseball external research, MVP-004F evidence-aware baseball forecaster, OPS-005 canon/agent-context). Alembic **`0012` → `0013`** via `run-baseline --dry-run`. `agent-context` verified on-host (phase, redacted SQLite URL, flags, boundaries, doc paths; no secrets printed).

**Flags before → after** (one-flag-discipline, appended to `.env` which predates these keys):

| Flag | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_BASEBALL_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH` | absent (false) | **true** |
| `ENABLE_BASEBALL_EVIDENCE_FORECASTING` | absent (false) | **true** |
| `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH` / `ENABLE_LLM_FORECASTING` / `ENABLE_LLM_RESOLUTION` | false | false (unchanged — **no global LLM/external research**) |
| `ENABLE_REALTIME_WATCHER` | true | true |

**Verification sequence and results**

- Pre-rollout data intact: 392 outcomes, 48 forecasts / 57 scores (**9 resolved — template baseline Brier 0.1471, log-loss 0.4465**), 286 signals, 7.7k ticks, 38 MiB SQLite. All three units active; watcher journal clean.
- Default-mode control (flags false): promoted+processed signal #284 → `research=template/template_only completeness=0.65`, forecaster `template_baseline`. Correct.
- Canary mode: promoted 3 MLB total signals (SD@LAD, live at 6–10 through the middle 6th); **all 3 produced `baseball-external` source-backed packets at completeness 1.00 (0 fallbacks)** with official MLB Stats API provenance (url/title/credibility/fetched_at persisted), and **all 3 forecasts used `baseball_evidence` v1** with tags `[sports_baseball, source_backed, baseball_evidence_v1, market_type_total, early_game, live_game_state, evidence_adjusted]`. Coherent ladder: line 18 p 0.70→0.7773, line 19 p 0.59→0.6471, line 20 p 0.495→0.5238 (evidence estimates 0.84/0.69/0.55), confidence 0.60 (< 0.70 cap).
- Post-rollout: watcher restarted onto new code + env, polling cleanly (0 errors); baseline/retention timers active; canary flags visible in `agent-context`; `forecasts by forecaster: baseball_evidence=3, template_baseline=49`.
- Safety grep (incl. swap/Jupiter/wallet/EV/paper/order terms): no implementation surface. Only nuanced hit: `app/services/ws_snapshots.py` — the dormant MVP-001 read-only WebSocket *market-data* client, which signs channel subscriptions with a Kalshi API key (data-feed auth, not wallet/custody); no key configured on this host, service disabled.

**Caveats**

1. EVO-X2 cannot `git push` (anonymous HTTPS clone); this report is committed/pushed from the dev machine and pulled on the host.
2. The processed SDLAD signals were slightly stale (game had progressed since signal creation) — expected; evidence reflects packet-creation time and forecasts state that.
3. `market_price_ticks` now ~7.9k rows; the daily retention timer (first firing tonight) bounds growth at the 7-day window.
4. Calibration cohorts: `baseball_evidence` forecasts now accumulate alongside `template_baseline`; comparisons need those markets to settle first.

**Rollback (baseball canary only)**

```bash
cd ~/projects/probability-arena
sed -i 's/^ENABLE_BASEBALL_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH=.*/ENABLE_BASEBALL_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH=false/' .env
sed -i 's/^ENABLE_BASEBALL_EVIDENCE_FORECASTING=.*/ENABLE_BASEBALL_EVIDENCE_FORECASTING=false/' .env
systemctl --user restart probability-arena-watcher.service
systemctl --user status probability-arena-watcher.service
```

**Log inspection**

```bash
journalctl --user -u probability-arena-watcher.service   -n 200 --no-pager
journalctl --user -u probability-arena-baseline.service  -n 100 --no-pager
journalctl --user -u probability-arena-retention.service -n 50  --no-pager
