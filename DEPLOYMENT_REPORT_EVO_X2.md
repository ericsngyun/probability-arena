# Deployment Report — Probability Arena on EVO-X2 (`mikolabs`)

Date: 2026-07-03 (UTC) · Status: **deployed, timer enabled and scheduled**
Companion: `DEPLOYMENT_AUDIT_EVO_X2.md` (Phase 1 audit and path rationale)

## Deployment summary

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Path chosen | **Host Python venv + systemd user timer** (Docker Compose rejected: would add a redundant Postgres/Redis set to an already loaded shared host) |
| Repo path | `/home/miko_node_001/projects/probability-arena` |
| Commit deployed | `d009433` (`main`; includes MVP-004D `0cd62b0`) |
| Python / venv | Python 3.12.3 → `.venv` inside the repo (created `--without-pip` + get-pip bootstrap; host lacks `python3.12-venv` and passwordless sudo — no system packages installed) |
| Database | **SQLite** at `~/projects/probability-arena/data/probability_arena.db`, Alembic at head **`0011`**, 14 tables. Not Postgres: `master-postgres` belongs to the awaas stack, publishes no host port, and pgbouncer has no db routing (see audit). |
| Redis | Default `redis://localhost:6379/0` — intentionally unreachable on this host. The baseline CLI never uses Redis; the app's only Redis use (API candidate cache) degrades gracefully to cache-miss. |
| LLM / external flags | `ENABLE_LLM_RESOLUTION=false`, `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH=false`, `ENABLE_LLM_FORECASTING=false` (verified in `.env`) |
| Trading surface | **None.** Safety grep on the deployed tree found no order/wallet/execution/live-or-paper-trading/sizing/EV/recommendation implementation surface. The adjacent `~/awaas/trading/` project on this host is unrelated and shares nothing with this deployment (no env, no DB, no services). |
| Timer | `probability-arena-baseline.timer` (user unit) **enabled + active (waiting)**; every 4 h (`OnCalendar=*-*-* 00/4:00:00`, `RandomizedDelaySec=300`, `Persistent=true`). Next trigger at install time: 04:04 UTC. Lingering already enabled, so the timer survives logout/reboot. No root/system units touched. |

## Verification results (all on EVO-X2)

- **Dry run** (`run-baseline --dry-run`): pipeline run 1, `status=dry_run`, 8 skipped stage audit rows, 50 ms, no downstream rows.
- **Manual live baseline** (`--scan-limit 300 --candidate-limit 8 --sync-outcome-limit 20 --score-limit 100`): pipeline run 2, `status=completed` in 18.2 s — scan 300/300, enrich 8/8, assess 8/8, research 8/8, forecast 8/8, sync 20/20, score 8/8, report ✓. Confirms Kalshi egress from EVO-X2 works (read-only GETs; no credentials, no trading permissions).
- **systemd-triggered run** (`systemctl --user start …service`): pipeline run 3 with full `.env` defaults, `status=completed` in 54.3 s (scan 500/500, 20 candidates through the chain, 200 outcomes synced, 20 new scores with the 8 already-current scores correctly skipped by dedup). Exit `0/SUCCESS`, clean journal.
- **`pipeline-status`**: lists runs 3/2/1 with correct statuses and full stage table.
- **`calibration-report`**: works; all scores currently `pending_outcome` (forecasts are on unresolved markets — expected on day one; resolved counts accrue as markets settle and later runs re-score).
- **Timer status**: `active (waiting)`, trigger scheduled, `Triggers: probability-arena-baseline.service`.

## Caveats

1. **SQLite, not Postgres.** Deliberate (see audit). If a dedicated Postgres is provisioned later, point `DATABASE_URL` at it and rerun migrations — `run_migrations()` builds from zero; note the SQLite history would need a one-off copy if continuity matters.
2. **Pre-existing failed user units** (`arena-daily.service`, `syncthing.service`) keep the user manager `degraded`. Unrelated to this deployment; not touched.
3. **The service unit is `disabled` by design** — it is activated by the enabled timer (`TriggeredBy`), which is the correct oneshot+timer shape.
4. Scores stay `pending_outcome` until markets settle; with same-day sports dominating candidates, resolved scores should appear within ~24 h of runs.
5. `.env` currently holds no secrets (no Kalshi credentials needed for read-only data; LLM disabled). If credentials are ever added, they stay in `.env` (mode 600 recommended) and must never be committed.

## Operations

Disable the schedule:
```bash
systemctl --user disable --now probability-arena-baseline.timer
```
(Re-enable: `systemctl --user enable --now probability-arena-baseline.timer`)

Inspect logs and state:
```bash
systemctl --user status probability-arena-baseline.timer
systemctl --user status probability-arena-baseline.service
journalctl --user -u probability-arena-baseline.service -n 100 --no-pager
systemctl --user list-timers | grep probability-arena
cd ~/projects/probability-arena && .venv/bin/python -m app.cli pipeline-status
cd ~/projects/probability-arena && .venv/bin/python -m app.cli calibration-report
```

Update the deployment:
```bash
cd ~/projects/probability-arena
git pull --ff-only
.venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements-dev.txt   # if deps changed
.venv/bin/python -m app.cli run-baseline --dry-run # migrations + audit sanity
```
